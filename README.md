# Rice-leaf-disease-project
## INTRODUCTION
##### Convolutional neural networks are mainly used for image classification problems. The same is used in this project for classifying images of rice plant infected by either of the three most common rice diseases, that are:
##### Bacterial leaf blight
##### Brown spot
##### Leaf smut
##### The dataset given for training and testing the model contained images of rice leaves. There are three classes/diseases: Bacterial leaf blight, Brown spot, and Leaf smut, each having 40 images. The format of all images are jpg.Majority of the images comprises of the picture of the infected leaf in a white background. These images where uploaded to drive for using in colab, wherin either of the two GPUs (Nvidia Tesla T4 or Nvidia Tesla G80) was allocated for image processing. The project was also tried out in Jupyter notebook, where the system GPU was utilized using the Nvidia CUDA and CuDNN softwares.
